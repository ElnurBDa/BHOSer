#### Third generation (3G) of cellular communications 

- it makes sure that you have good connection and services travelling all over the world
- International Telecommunications Union (ITU) had this idea in 1997
- the project named IMT-2000

IMT-2000 project had these intentions:
1. **Offering Services Anywhere (Global too):** This means making it easy for people with mobile phones to get lots of different services, no matter where they are. 
2. **More Services, Less Problems:** They want to give us even more services without worrying about things like how much data can be sent through the airwaves or how expensive it is to run the system.
3. **Different Speeds for Different Situations:** Depending on whether you're walking around, driving, or staying still, they want to give you the right speed for your internet connection. Like faster speeds if you're sitting at home and slower speeds if you're moving around. Such as
	1. 2Mbps provided for fixed environments
	2. 384 Kbps for pedestrian
	3. 144 Kbps for vehicular traffic.
4. **Keeping You Connected:** They want to keep track of where your phone is and make sure you stay connected.
5. **Making it Safer:** They want to fix any problems with the security of current mobile networks, like GSM.



2G has some robust and useful mechanisms on 4 different aspects, and 3GPP technology, also need to keep these mechanisms
- SIM-based authentication
- confidentiality of user traffic on the air interface
- radio interface encryption
- confidentiality of user identity on the radio interface.


#### 3G Networks

Wireless networks are getting better at doing more stuff, like providing different services. But as they improve, they also get more complicated. Basically, all 3G networks use similar main parts in how they're set up and how they talk to each other.

**Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS)** is type of network for mobile phones, the next generation of GSM an GPRS. It can handle faster data speeds
- UMTS achieves this by using a technology called Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA) for its radio interface
- This technology is part of what's called the UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network (UTRAN), land-based part of UMTS

**Network architecture**

![[Pasted image 20240428151658.png]]

UMTS is divided into 2 parts:
- Core Network (CN)
- Generic Radio Access Network (GRAN).

1. **Core Network (CN)**: This is administrative part, where decisions are made and resources are managed. The CN has two main parts:
    - **Circuit-Switched (CS) domain**:  It's for handling things voice calls, where a dedicated line is set up for each call. 
    - **Packet-Switched (PS) domain**: This part is more like sending emails or using apps on your phone. Data is broken into small pieces called packets, which can travel independently. This is great for things like internet browsing or sending messages because it's efficient and flexible.
    - it includes:
	    - databases that store user profiles
	    - userâ€™s access authorizations
	    - use of a number of switching entities and gateways to the external networks
1. **Generic Radio Access Network (GRAN)**: This where all the connections to phones and devices happen. It's responsible for communicating with your phone and making sure you can connect to the network wherever you are. t's made up of two main parts: 
	1. Node-Bs
		1. sends and receives signals to and from your phone within its coverage area
		2. Each Node-B covers one or more areas called radio cells
	2. Radio Network Controllers
		1. the manager of the Node-Bs
		2. connects the Node-Bs to the main network
		3. responsible for making decisions about when your phone should switch from one Node-B to another (called handoff), and it coordinates this with your phone through signals.


#### USIM
Like GSM uses SIM card, in UMTS, there's Universal Subscriber Identity Module (USIM) that does the same thing.
- contains important information about you (identity and what services you're allowed to use)
- It has security features to keep data safe

UMTS mobile stations work in different modes:
1. **Circuit Switching Mode:** Your phone is only connected to the circuit-switched (CS) part of the network, so it can only use services like voice calls.
2. **Packet Switching Mode:** Phone is only connected to the packet-switched (PS) part of the network, which is used for things like internet browsing. You can use internet services, and sometimes even make voice calls over the internet.
3. **PS/CS Mode:**  Phone is connected to both the PS and CS parts of the network, so you can use services from both, like making voice calls and browsing the internet simultaneously.

USIM is an application stored in a removable smart card, which interoperates with the mobile equipment to provide access to 3G services. Similar to the SIM card, USIM has the following features: 
- it identifies a unique mobile subscriber
- it stores subscription related information
- it authenticates itself to the network and vice-versa
- it provides security functions
- it stores information elements such as the preferred language, international mobile subscriber identity (IMSI), and cipher key.


#### Security

- security characteristic (encryption, authentication)
- security mechanism (action of applying these characteristics)

**UMTS Security Architecture**
1. **Network access security (Class I)**: This is about making sure that when you're connecting to 3G services, your connection is secure and protected from any attacks that could happen over the airwaves.
2. **Network domain security (Class II)**: This focuses on securing the communication between different parts of the phone network itself, making sure that the messages sent between network nodes are safe from any attacks, especially those targeting the wired parts of the network.
3. **User domain security (Class III)**: This is all about keeping your mobile device safe when it's accessing the 3G network and its services, like making sure that your phone's connection to the network is secure.
4. **Application domain security (Class IV)**: These functions are designed to ensure that when applications on your phone communicate with the network or with other applications, that communication is done securely, so your data and information stay safe.
5. **Visibility and configurability of security (Class V)**: This class is about giving you, the user, the ability to see what security measures are in place for you, and to control some aspects of those security features. For example, you might be able to check if a service you're using is protected by certain security features, and you might have the option to turn some security features on or off.


2G had following weaknesses and 3G mitigated them:
- active attacks using a rogue BTS are launchable in 2G networks
- the cipher keys and authentication data are transmitted in clear between and within networks
- the encryption is only performed on the wireless link. This may result in the transmission of user and signaling data in a non-crypted form
- the data integrity is not provided. 
- the IMEI is an unsecured identity
- the 2G systems do not have the flexibility to upgrade and improve security functionality over time.

#### DoS

In older 2G networks, messages sent over the airwaves weren't checked to make sure they were really from who they said they were from. So, a bad actor could fake these messages without the system realizing it.
By faking these messages, attackers could trick the network into doing things like kicking a user off the network or making it seem like the user is in a different location than they actually are.
To stop this, newer systems now check the integrity of messages and make sure they're not being repeated. So, these kinds of attacks don't work anymore on 3G networks.


#### Identity Catching

someone could secretly capture your identity information, like your phone number, without you knowing. They could do this by either just listening in (passive attack) or by tricking your phone into revealing your identity (active attack)
But in 3G networks, they fixed these vulnerabilities. Now, even if someone tries to eavesdrop on your identity (passive attack), they won't be able to get your real identity easily because your phone gets assigned temporary identities by the network, which keeps changing.
Also your identity is protected by encryption.


#### Impersonation of the Network Attacks

1. **Impersonating a Legitimate Network**: This means pretending to be a real network that users trust. The goal is to either listen in on the data users are sending or to send them fake information that looks like it's coming from a real network or user.
2. **Three Types of Attacks**:
    a. **Impersonating the Network by Disabling Encryption**: Here, the attacker tries to stop the encryption between the target user and themselves. Encryption is like a secret code that keeps data safe during transmission. In 3G networks, there are measures in place to detect if someone is trying to mess with this encryption.
    b. **Impersonating the Network by Disabling Encryption with the Legitimate Network**: This attack involves stopping the encryption between the target user and the real network they're supposed to be connected to. To prevent this, 3G networks have systems in place to check if encryption is being turned off by someone unauthorized.
    c. **Impersonating the Network by Making Users Use a Weak Encryption Key**: This attack relies on using a secret code (cipher key) that has been compromised, meaning it's been stolen or tampered with. Even in 3G networks, attackers can sometimes use these compromised keys to do harm.



#### Eavesdropping on User Data

1. **Listening in on the Conversation**: They might try to listen in on your conversation by somehow turning off the encryption, which is like the secret code that keeps your messages safe. In some newer systems, there are protections to make sure this doesn't happen, like a way for your phone to check if the encryption is still working properly.
2. **Tricking the Network**: Instead of trying to listen in directly on your conversation, they might try to trick the network itself into thinking that everything is okay, even though they've turned off the encryption. Again, in newer systems, there are checks in place to catch this kind of trickery.
3. **Using a Fake Key**: Lastly, they might try to use a fake secret code to decrypt your messages. Even if the network is working perfectly and your phone is checking for any funny business, if they can somehow get their hands on the right fake code, they can still read your messages.



#### Classification of Attacks on 3G Networks 
1. Classification by Type: 
	1. Interception: Attacker intercepts information or reads signaling messages on a cable without modifying them. 
	2. Fabrication/Replay: Attacker inserts false signaling messages, fake service logic, or fake subscriber data into the system. 
	3. Modification of Resources: Attacker modifies signaling messages, service logic, or subscriber data in the network. 
	4. Denial of Service: Attacker causes overload or disruption in network resources or applications. 
	5. Interruption: Attacker causes an interruption of operation by destroying resources or deleting signaling messages or subscriber data
2. Classification by Means
	1. Data-based attacks: Attacker targets data stored in the 3G communication system, causing damage by modifying, inserting, or dropping data. 
	2. Messages-based attacks: Attacker targets signaling messages, inserting, modifying, replaying, or dropping them. 
	3. Service Logic attacks: Attacker attacks service logic running in 3G network entities, causing significant damage.
3. Classification by Physical Access
	1. Physical Access attacks I: Attacker obtains access to the air interface using a physical device, impersonating parts of the network or eavesdropping. 
	2. Physical Access attacks II: Attacker obtains access to cables connecting 3G network switches, disrupting normal transmission of signaling messages. 
	3. Physical Access attacks III: Attacker has access to sensitive components of the 3G network, causing impairments by editing service logic or modifying subscriber data. 
	4. Physical Access attacks IV: Attacker has access to links connecting the Internet to the 3G network, disrupting transmission of signaling messages. 
	5. Physical Access attacks V: Attacker has access to Internet or cross-network servers providing services to mobile subscribers, editing service logic or modifying subscriber data.
