**GSM - Global System for Mobile Telecommunication**
- it is a popular way to communicate for mobile phone users
- it lets you move between different GSM networks without interruption
- it doesn't stamp identity to the device itself, it uses SIM card (Subscriber Identity Module)
- it holds important information about you, phone number etc.
- You can take the SIM card out and put into any GSM phone, and it will


Security is important there because people can send important files with these cards. There are some security issues currently
1. The security methods GSM uses aren't shared with the public. It can lead to a false sense of security because it's difficult for experts to verify their effectiveness.
2. communication between phone and cell tower is encrypted, but not between cell towers and core network so they can be intercepted and manipulated
4. the cryptographic mechanisms are difficult to upgrade;
5. the mobile subscriber visibility is missing, lack of location visibility can pose challenges for emergency responders in situations where public safety or security is at risk.

### Infrastructure

**A GSM network involves nine major components**
1. **Mobile Station (MS)**: This is your mobile device, like a smartphone or a feature phone.
2. **Subscriber Identity Module (SIM)**: It's a small card that contains your personal information, like your phone number and contacts. You can put it into any compatible phone to use your number and services.
3. **Base Station Subsystem (BSS)**: It's a collection of equipment that connects your phone to the mobile network, including base stations and controllers.
4. **Base Station Controller (BSC)**: This manages communication between the base stations and the rest of the network.
5. **Transcoding Rate and Adaptation Unit (TRAU)**: It's responsible for converting voice signals from digital to analog and vice versa, ensuring clear communication.
6. **Mobile Services Switching Center (MSC)**: It's like a central hub that connects calls and messages between different users and networks.
7. **Home Location Register (HLR)**: It's a database that stores information about subscribers, like their phone numbers and services.
8. **Visitor Location Register (VLR)**: It's a temporary database that stores information about subscribers who are currently roaming in a different area.
9. **Equipment Identity Register (EIR)**: It's a database that stores information about mobile devices, like their unique identifiers, to prevent the use of stolen or unauthorized devices.


Some other components:
1. **Operation and Support System (OMC)**: It's a system used by network operators to monitor and manage the GSM network.
2. **Authentication Center (AuC)**: It's a component responsible for verifying the identity of subscribers and ensuring secure communication over the network.


*Together, all these components constitute a Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN). It's the entire GSM network covering a specific geographic area.*

### GSM Security

- **mobile user’s privacy**
- **data integrity protection**

is required for following activities:
- call setup
- voice-based services protection
- privacy of location
- privacy of calling patterns
- privacy of user identity
- protection of data


in call-setup, mobile terminal sends these information to GSM network:
1. calling party number
2. calling card number
3. service type requested
These must be protected and secured against eavesdroppers. All communication must be encrypted.
Out-leaking of signals from mobile terminal to GSM network can help attackers to track users, collect information about them. It is also important to check if data integrity while transmission 

There is "replication" that can mess up these GSM systems. 
One way attackers do this is by "cloning" your phone. Cloning basically means they figure out info about your phone and make an exact copy of it. They do this by gathering info stored in your SIM card. They could use it as if they were you, use services without paying or do something bad.

In GSM systems information about your account is kept separate from your actual phone. So if phone is stolen, it can used again by other user
to prevent it, each phone must have a unique identification number that's recognized worldwide. it becomes harder for someone else to use it again because it's linked to that specific identification number.
These identification numbers are usually built into the phone in a way that makes them very difficult to tamper with.

#### Auth process
1. **Ku** is the shared secret value stored on SIM card, not accessible to user
2. In authentication, network sends a random number (RAND) and SIM card uses these 2 value for authentication algorithm, provide a value SRES, and create a session key Ks
3. The user is authenticated if the provided SRES matches the value of SRES that is computed separately by the GSM network
4. The encryption is performed using key Ks
5. It provides anonymity, user authentication, and confidentiality but not network authentication.


#### Anonymity
In GSM, when you turn on your phone, it first uses your real identity to connect to the network, but then it gets assigned a temporary identifier called TMSI for future connections within a specific area. This TMSI is always encrypted by the network for extra security.

#### Confidentiality
A8 is used to generate a session key Ks. 
Ks is utilized for voice and data encryption before transmission on the radio link
Algorithm A5 uses Ks and the current publicly known frame number to produce a key stream of 228 bits, decomposed into two halves. While the first half encrypts the downlink frame (going from the base station to the MS), the second half is used to encrypt the uplink frame (going from the MS back to the base station)


### GSM Security Flaws

1. No authentication of the network is provided to the user
2. Common implementation of A3/A8 is flawed
3. Vulnerabilities in the subscriber identity confidentiality mechanism
	1. If the network somehow loses track of a particular TMSI, it must ask the subscriber to submit its IMSI over the radio link, using a special mechanism for identity request. Thus, the IMSI is sent in plaintext
	2. attacker can use this to map a TMSI to its IMSI
4. air cracking of Ku
	1. The attacker can imitate a valid base station
	2. the attacker gets the MS’s IMSI by sending to the MS an identity request 
	3. The attacker collects the (RAND, SRES) pairs until he gains enough information to derive the key Ku

##### Impersonation attack

1. **Impersonating the network**: This sneaky person pretends to be the network to your device. So, your device thinks it's talking to the real network, but it's actually talking to the sneaky person.
2. **Impersonating your device**: Now, this sneaky person also pretends to be your device to the network. So, the network thinks it's talking to your device, but it's actually talking to the sneaky person.
3. **Man-in-the-middle attack**: By doing both of these tricks, the sneaky person can sit in the middle of your communication. They can spy on what you're saying, change or delete your messages, or even pretend to be you to someone else.

They need a modified device (like a phone) and a modified base station (like a Wi-Fi router or cell tower) to do it


##### Attacks on the Authentication Algorithm

changing the algorithm used in SIM cards from COMP128 to a stronger one is tricky.
1. **Old SIM Cards Stick Around:** The algorithm used in SIM cards is stored inside them. So, even if a new, stronger algorithm is introduced, people with existing SIM cards can't switch to it easily. They're stuck with the old algorithm.
2. **New Subscribers Get the Better Version:** New SIM cards can have the updated, more secure version of COMP128. But this creates a problem. You end up with a mix of old and new SIM cards, which makes the authentication process less efficient.
3. **COMP128 Isn't as Secure as We'd Like:** Even though the COMP128 algorithm was supposed to be kept secret, people have figured it out. It's been reverse-engineered and analyzed. Because the GSM specification (the standard for SIM cards) is public, all you need to clone a SIM card is the secret key for COMP128 and the IMSI number stored in the card
