Think of SMS like sending little electronic notes between cell phones. You type a message on your phone, hit send, and it goes to the other person's phone. But there's a middleman called the Short Message Service Center (SMSC) that helps send the message from your phone to theirs. It's like a mailbox for text messages. Once the message reaches the SMSC, it checks if the other person is available to receive messages. If they are, it delivers the message to their phone.

Originally, SMS was just for sending short text messages, but now you can also send pictures, audio, and videos through a fancier version called Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS). And sometimes, cell phone companies use SMS to do other things like send voicemail notifications or update your phone's settings.

But, with all these cool features, there's also a downside. Since SMS is used for so much more now, it's become a target for hackers. In the past, it was really hard for hackers to mess with SMS because they needed special access to the phone's system and a deep understanding of how it works. But nowadays, with newer phones, it's easier for them to sneak in and cause trouble.


#### SMS Payload

Imagine you're sending a text message. Before your phone can send it, it has to put the message in a special format called a "protocol data unit," or PDU for short. This format has different parts, kind of like sections in a book.

First, there are some header fields at the beginning of the PDU. These fields hold important information about the message, like who it's going to and how it's encoded (basically, how the text is turned into data that can be sent over the network).

One important field in the header is called the "User Data Header," or UDH. This is where extra stuff can be added to the message. It's like adding a note or attachment to your text. This extra stuff could be anything, from multimedia content like pictures or videos to instructions for the receiving phone.

One common use of the UDH is for sending long messages. If your text is too long to fit in one message, the UDH tells the receiving phone to expect more parts of the message. Then, it puts all the parts together to show you the full message.

#### MMS

while both SMS and MMS might seem similar to users, they work quite differently behind the scenes. MMS requires more advanced technology and support from mobile carriers because it deals with a variety of media types, not just text. Unlike SMS, which uses one straightforward method, MMS involves multiple technologies to create and deliver messages. So, it's a bit more complex, but it lets you do a lot more than just send plain text.

**MMS notification**

1. Bob sends a multimedia message (like a photo or video). This message is called "M-Send-req."
2. The server that handles multimedia messages (MMSC) confirms that Bob's message was sent and lets him know with a message called "M-send-conf."
3. The MMSC sends a notification to Alice. This notification includes a web link (URL). This link could potentially be used for attacks.
4. Alice responds to the MMSC just to confirm she got the notification.
5. Alice clicks on the link in the notification. This might happen immediately or after a delay depending on what Alice does. This action could trigger different responses on different devices.
6. After Alice clicks the link, the MMSC sends her a message saying the content is ready to be viewed.
7. Alice confirms to the MMSC that she received the message and everything is complete.
8. Finally, the MMSC lets Bob know that the message he sent has been successfully delivered.

#### Protocol Attacks

Think of "protocol" attacks like different types of tricks or strategies. Within these tricks, there are two main types. The first type involves using something that's supposed to work in a certain way but using it in a sneaky or harmful way instead. 

For example, when you get a voicemail on your phone, the phone company sends you a message to let you know. They usually send this message as a special text (SMS). Instead of using this feature the way it's meant to be used, someone could send a specially crafted SMS to your phone to make it show you've got voicemails, even if you don't. It's like tricking your phone into thinking you have messages when you really don't.

Imagine you have a phone and you get a special message saying you have a new voicemail. Normally, only your phone company should send you this message. But sometimes, a bad person can fake this message and send it to you instead. It's not a huge problem, but it shows that some messages meant for important things can be faked and sent to you by someone who shouldn't be doing it.

#### Vulnerabilities in implementation

Sure! In simpler terms, some people try to find weaknesses in how text messages (SMS) are sent and received on mobile phones. They do this to see if they can make a phone do something bad by sending it a special kind of messed-up message. 

One way they try to mess things up is by sending a message that's not quite right in a technical sense. For instance, every message has a part that says how long the message is supposed to be. If someone tricks this part into saying the message is longer than it really is, it could cause the phone to have a problem and maybe even run bad code without the owner knowing.

### Attacks


##### Battery-Draining Attack

Imagine someone sending you a text message that secretly drains your phone's battery really quickly. They do this by tricking your phone into constantly staying connected to their server, which uses up a lot of battery power. They send you a message that looks like a regular one, but it's actually designed to keep your phone connected to their server for as long as possible. Even though you think you're just receiving a normal message, your phone is actually being drained of its battery without you knowing it. It's like someone sneaking into your house and leaving all the lights on, making your electricity bill skyrocket without you realizing it until it's too late.


##### Silent Billing Attack

Imagine you have a phone with prepaid credit, meaning you need money in your account to make calls or use data. Now, there's this sneaky trick called a silent billing attack. Here's how it works:

1. Normally, when you send or receive a regular text message (SMS), your phone shows it to you right away. But with fancier messages like MMS (which can include pictures or videos), there's extra stuff going on in the background that you don't see. Your phone quietly handles it without bothering you.

2. Bad guys use this hidden feature to mess with people who have prepaid phones. They flood the victim's phone with these sneaky background messages, like fake "Send Confirmations," which don't show up on the victim's screen.

3. Because these messages don't pop up, the victim doesn't notice anything strange happening. But behind the scenes, their prepaid credit is being drained without their knowledge.

4. Since the victim's phone doesn't display these messages, they have no idea their account is being emptied. Once all the credit is gone, the victim can't make calls or send texts anymore, even the regular ones.


##### OTA Settings Attack

Think of Over The Air (OTA) settings like getting updates or changes on your phone without having to physically do anything. Your phone company can send new stuff directly to your phone, like updates for your internet browser or even the basic software that runs your phone.

But, this ability isn't just for good things. It can also be used in a sneaky way. For example, someone might try to send shady browser settings to your phone. If they succeed, your phone could start sending all your internet traffic through their sneaky server instead of directly to the websites you want to visit. This means they could spy on what you're doing online or even mess with the websites you're trying to visit.
