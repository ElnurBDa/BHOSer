# What expect from Exam
- **solving system of equations - cramer's rule and gaussian elimination method - both must be learnt**
	- W2(1) - gaussian
	- W2(3) - cramer
- **Application of systems of equations in world problem.**
	- W5(2)
	- W6(1)
- **determinant of the matrix; properties of the determinant;** 
	- W2(2)
	- det = 0 => singular
	- det != 0 => unique sol
	- det = 0 =>
		- infinitity
		- no sol
- **inverse matrix;** 
	- W3(1)
	- not invertible if det = 0
	- gauss jordan 
	- ![[inverse.png]]
- tutorials like 6-8 can be solved
---
- **linearly dependent and independent vectors;**
	- W8(2)
	- W9(1) 
		- linear combination
	- independent - if in linear combination `c1=c2=...=0`
		- if we get
	- dependent - there are other combinations where `=0`
	- det !=0 then independent
- **basis and dimension of vectorspace;** 
	- span
		- W9(1)
		- if no sol then no span
		- if we get asked value from product of given vectors and scalars we found with solving the equations then span
	- basis conditions
		- span is ok
		- independent is ok
	- dimensions
		- basis is n vectors then dimension is n
		- reduced row echalon 
			- pivots are basis
	- W9(2)
	- W10(1)
- **eigenvalues and eigenvectors;** 
	- W11
	- `det|A-lambdaI|=0`
	- `lambda` - e-values
	- solving for a b c - e-vectors
- **diagonalisation;** 
	- W11
	- `A=XD(X^-1)`
		- `X=v1 v2 v3`
		- `D=l1 0`
		- `  0 l2`
- **powers of matrices;**
	- W11
	- `(A^n)=X(D^n)(X^-1)`
- tutorials 9-10
